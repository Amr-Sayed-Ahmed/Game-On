				<h3>Description :</h3>
				<p>Dead Space is a horror media franchise created by Glen Schofield and Michael Condrey, developed by Visceral Games and published by Electronic Arts.
					The franchise centers on a series of video games, and includes two films and a comic book series.
					The series began in 2008 as an eponymous video game aimed at creating, in Schofield's words, "the most terrifying game we could acquire"; the game was a success and spawned a prequel and later a sequel released in 2011.
					Each installment in the Dead Space series is a continuation or addition to a continuing storyline which began with the release of the original game.
					The game is set in a 26th-century science fiction universe featuring environments, weapons and characters typical of the genre. The series' chronology is not presented in a linear format, with sections of the story line presented in the form of either prequels or sequels, and in different media aside from video games.
					Generally speaking, the series focuses on an engineer named Isaac Clarke and the horrors that surround him.
					The series has been commercially and critically successful, selling over 10 million copies; the first game and its sequel received widely positive reviews from the majority of critics and the first game has received a number of industry awards for many different elements of its gameplay and development.
