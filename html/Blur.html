				<h3>Description :</h3>
                <p>
					Blur Racing is an intense and futuristic motorbike racing game in which you must race against the clock to set new 
					records on a variety of superb neon tracks. During each race you must reach various checkpoints before the clock runs out. 
					If you fail to do so your race is over so drive quickly but with control! 
					Throughout the race you can encounter different items that inflict debilitating effects on your bike such as 
					decreased speed and health reduction.
